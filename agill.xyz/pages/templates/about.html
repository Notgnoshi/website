    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I'm a graduate student in the Computational Sciences and Robotics program at <a href="https://sdsmt.edu" target="_blank">SD Mines</a>. My undergraduate degree is also from SD Mines, in Applied and Computational Mathematics. Interesting courses I've taken include</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Topology, Linear Programming, and Game Theory</li>
        <li>Deep Learning, Data Analysis, and Data Mining</li>
        <li>Cryptography, and Cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Parallel Computing, Natural Computing, Mathematical Modeling, and Robotics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I enjoy math and programming, and I think for the same reason. I like them because of the sense of accomplishment you get when you <em>build</em> something. That's an incredibly satisfying feeling.</p>

    <p>Getting a degree in mathematics has taught me some of the most important lessons that I think I've learned. It's taught me how to struggle, for example. Struggling is a normal part of problem solving, but there are effective and ineffective approaches to solving hard problems.</p>

    <h1>About This Site</h1>

    <p>It's yet another personal website cluttering search engine result pages. This one happens to be written in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>, and served using <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank">Nginx</a> and <a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">uWSGI</a>, mostly as an excuse to use buzzwords. Also, I got tired of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> breaking with every update.</p>
