            <h1>1.a. The Haiku Form</h1>
            <p>
                If we wish to generate haiku, we must first understand what haiku <em>are</em>. Since its exposure to
                western audiences, its popularity as a poetic form has veritably exploded. As such, there are many
                online resources discussing the intricacy of the form. This is intended to be a general overview, as any
                attempt to do otherwise would do the form a disservice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haiku are a form of Japanese poetry. In their original form, they were the first three lines of a
                <em>waka</em>, also known as a <em>tanka</em> or <em>uta</em>. Waka are a five-line, 5-7-5-7-7 poem,
                that are often strung together into <em>renga</em>, which are a linked verse dialog between multiple
                poets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of these long poems, composed of many waka, the first three lines are called a
                <em>hokku</em>. The hokku are the most recognizable and impressionable verses of renga, and are analgous
                to the first verse and chorus of a song. Renga were composed in meetings of several poets, and it was
                common for poets to come prepared with pre-composed hokku.
            </p>
            <p>These hokku are what is now referred to as <em>haiku</em>.</p>
            <p>
                Upon sharing my work in haiku generation, the very first question that arises often has to do with the
                5-7-5 syllabic structure. The common perception of haiku, is that it is a poem, composed of three lines
                of 5, 7, and 5 syllables each, with no further constraints. This is only partially true.
            </p>
            <p><b>Haiku maintain a thematic structure as well.</b></p>
            <p>
                It is difficult, even impossible, to maintain the original syllabic structure in translation from
                Japanese to English. Thus many translators have striven to match the style, theme, and mood of a
                Japanese haiku, and while maintaining its three-line structure, they abandon the strict syllabic
                requirement. Further, note that, as with any style of art, there was experimentation with a freer verse
                style, both in content and structure, long before the haiku grew to popularity in western culture.
            </p>
            <p>Joan Giroux defines</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0 border-left border-2 pl-2">
                A haiku is a 17-syllable poem arranged in three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllable, having some reference to
                the season and expression the poet's union with nature.

            <p>
                Regardless of its definition, the dataset I have collected does not exhibit
                <a href="/research/haiku/analysis/syllables">strict syllabic structure</a>, but <em>does</em> seem to
                exhibit the strong <a href="/research/haiku/analysis/word-clouds">seasonal and natural aspects</a> that
                Giroux describes. Because a neural network model is only as good as its training dataset, I do not
                expect the generated haiku to follow the 5-7-5 syllabic structure, but I <em>do</em> expect them to
                exhibit strong natural themes.
            </p>

                <b
                    >Further, what interests me about this project has little to do with the particular poetic form
                    under consideration, but the ability for a machine learning model to generate <em>art</em>, and in
                    that respect, I believe my efforts have been categorically successful.</b
