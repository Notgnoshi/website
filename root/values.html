            <h1>Personal values</h1>
            <p>
                A few days ago, I was in some internal training where we went through an exercise to help us determine
                our core values. While to some degree I already knew what my values were, I found the exercise helped me
                put my core values into perspective against the backdrop of the rest of my values. This exercise also
                helped explain some of what I've found most frustrating at work.
            </p>
            <p>
                My core values are <strong>interrogation</strong>, <strong>trust</strong>, and
                <strong>openness</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2>Interrogation</h2>
            <p>
                This is an odd one, that I doubt you'd see if you were to Google for a list of personal values. But I've
                learned that it's <em>really</em> important to me to &quot;dig in&quot;, to ask (and answer!) questions
                that are difficult to answer with my current level of understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continual growth is a common value (I hope, anyways), and it's somewhat related. You <em>have</em> to
                grow, to learn, and to become more capable to interrogate systems you don't understand. While the
                understanding is important (vital, in fact), that's not what's most important to me. What I find
                important, is the ability to be confronted with a problem I don't understand, and to pull on whatever
                threads I find until I construct an understanding that's useful enough to take action on. It's about
                saying &quot;Huh. This doesn't match my expectation. Why?&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also related to &quot;drive&quot;. It takes strategic planning, patience, dedication, and the
                ability to be frustrated without getting discouraged to start pulling on threads. Most importantly
                though, it also requires you to recognize tunnel vision so that you can pull back and ask &quot;What am
                I <em>actually</em> trying to do here?&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tend to do depth-first searches rather than breadth-first. The unfortunate thing about software, is
                that there's a <em>huge</em> amount of depth -- eventually, you get to the fundamental laws of
                mathematics, and let me tell you what, my manager <em>loves</em> being told a bug fix is mathematically
                impossible. So it's important to know when to start popping sub-problems off the stack so you can focus
                on things to move you closer to your goals.
            </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                At work, we recently updated a project to use Rust 1.62.1 instead of 1.60.0 (the feature we wanted was
                stabilized in 1.61.0, but 1.62.1 was the latest stable release at the time), and doing so broke a
                doctest somewhat unexpectedly -- all of a sudden, that particular test could no longer find a shared
                library!
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I found the issue by running <code>rustdoc</code> from 1.60.0 and 1.62.1 with
                <code>strace</code>, and then diffing a few million lines of output, which was a messy diff, because the
                strace logs contained version numbers, timestamps, and hashes, which were uninteresting diffs.
            </p>
            <p>
                After getting my difftool to ignore these uninteresting differences, I was able to determine the cause
                to be <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95604">rust#95604</a>, which was exacerbated by
                <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8531">cargo#8531</a> but only after significant. (but
                super interesting) effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result? We disabled that test, which was the original recommendation of the team, but I wasn't
                comfortable <em>disabling</em> a <em>test</em> without first knowing <em>why</em> it was failing.
            </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                A colleague volunteered to work on a bug ticket in a system I'm very familiar with (I wrote the bug üôÅ).
                I gave them some advice, and told them I had a suspicion of which subsystem the bug was in, but that the
                application log files would tell them for sure, as long as they changed the log level to DEBUG.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I recommended turning up the default log level to DEBUG before attempting to reproduce. I made this
                recommendation over several standups, and to my dismay, this colleague had <em>no</em> interest in
                looking at the logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                After we finally reproduced the issue together in an unrelated meeting several weeks later, and wouldn't
                you know it, looking at the logs pointed out the root cause in a single digit number of minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course I <em>knew</em> what to look for, and I <em>knew</em> that the information was there. But my
                colleague wasn't willing to &quot;dig in&quot; to the logs (they're somewhat verbose, but if you turn
                only the subsystem you're interested in to DEBUG level, they have a pretty high signal-to-noise ratio).
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found this to be true over the last few years -- that I tend to immediately jump to looking at the
                log files (or core dumps and screenshots; things that are tangible and can't be argued with), even going
                as far as regularly comparing the log files of one system to an adjacent, related system. It's a skill
                that I've built up over time; being able to debug a system by reconstructing the events from logs files.
                And I've put significant effort in making the software I work on understandable by paying close
                attention to what we log, and when we log it. But what I've found when suggesting to coworkers that they
                look at the logs, is that they don't want to &quot;dig in&quot;, to start looking at what
                <em>actually</em> happened, and why that might not match their expectation of what
                <em>should</em> happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is frustrating, when &quot;digging in&quot; is something I <em>highly</em> value -- especially when
                I <em>know</em> the information we need is there (because I <em>put</em> it there!) -- and it's not
                valued by my peers.
            </p>
            <h2>Trust results in freedom</h2>
            <p>
                I've also learned that I value freedom. I don't respond well when I'm told how to do something,
                <em>especially</em> if it's something I'm a subject matter expert in (or even just barely competent,
                like washing the dishes, but that's a story I do <em>not</em> want to expound on).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, this has come up at work in how we approve and merge pull requests. Someone was upset with
                a recent change, and changed the project settings so that only a few people could approve and merge pull
                requests. This person was <em>not</em> a project owner, and made this change without expressing their
                concern, or talking to the rest of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                So now, I can review someone else's code, but my approval is no longer good enough?! And when it
                <em>is</em> approved, even by one of the select few, I can't even <em>merge</em> it?!?! As a senior
                engineer, and an owner of the project?!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now don't get me wrong, it's not the freedom to write and merge whatever I damn well please that I'm
                after. I understand the value of code review, and believe that <em>every</em> submission should be
                reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what happened, was that someone was disappointed, decided they didn't trust the team, and instead of
                building up that trust, instead of addressing the issue, they built up nonsensical controls that
                <em>perpetuated</em> the lack of trust.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's easy to focus on freedom, as it's easier to measure. But it wasn't the change in freedom that bent
                me out of shape. I think it's perfectly acceptable to have a list of who can and can't approve pull
                requests. What I learned about myself, is that I value <em>trust</em>, and that I don't function well in
                a team that doesn't trust each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you <em>are</em> in such a team (I am now, and I love it), this trust results in quite a few
                positive outcomes
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code reviews become more respectful, and productive</li>
                <li>We become more open about failure, and consequently growth</li>
                <li>
                    We become more open about receiving feedback (or even becoming <em>willing</em> to receive feedback)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I come to work every day <em>excited</em> to work on both the project, <em>and</em> with the team
                    I'm on. This is <em>incredible</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We have the <em>freedom</em> to adapt our processes, our software, and our workflow to our needs
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This has come up when discussing certain design patterns in projects owned by other teams. There's a
                certain family of projects at work, where the owner doesn't trust the technical excellence of their
                team, which caused them to reach for some quite complex design patterns to make things &quot;just
                magically work&quot; without trusting the team to understand what the needs of each project are, and to
                configure them appropriately. This colleague's goals is no No-Code their way to victory. That would be a
                quite cool technical achievement, but my perspective is that it's born from a lack of trust (which isn't
                completely baseless, there's opportunities for excellence anywhere and everywhere).
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of responding to a lack of trust by throwing up more and more controls, I value responding by
                building up the trust level -- doing more training, having conversations on what I want to see in a high
                quality piece of software.
            </p>
            <p>A culture of trust and respect results in freedom.</p>
            <h2>Openness enables opinionation</h2>
            <blockquote class="blockquote border-left border-2 pl-2">
                <p>Strong opinions loosely held.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I'm an opinionated person, and the ability to express my opinions is important to me. I do not hesitate
                to say &quot;I disagree, here's what I think, and why&quot;, and it's important to me that I work in an
                environment where this is possible. But I work on a team <em>full</em> of opinionated engineers who
                don't hesitate to voice their own opinions. And our opinions are all <em>different</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your first reaction might be &quot;That sounds <em>hellish</em>, how do you get anything
                <em>done</em>?&quot; but I really quite the dynamic. I think it's only successful because of the culture
                of trust and mutual respect that the team has built over the past few months.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the ways I think we've built this culture, is through being open to changing our opinion, and
                through being open to trying something that doesn't quite sit comfortably. It's sometimes pretty hard --
                a lot of our opinions are on things that we've personally experience pain with, and we don't want to
                experience that pain again! This can result in very <em>strongly held</em> opinions.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a few ways that we've still been able to be productive without requesting transfers to another
                team. To a person, we're all open to changing our opinions when presented a (compelling) reason.
                Sometimes though, we have to say &quot;Okay, I don't quite agree, but I'm willing to help you try it
                out&quot;. This has been important, because each team member has different strengths, and is a subject
                matter expert in <em>some</em> part of the system. So we frequently say &quot;Seeing
                <em>this</em> surprised me, I initially though <em>that</em> might be better&quot;. Sometimes, the
                resolution is &quot;Oh, yeah, that's pretty sweet&quot;. Sometimes though, the resolution is &quot;I
                tried that, but here's why it didn't work&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, I've even found us having heated disagreements over how much we agree. Communication is the
                single hardest thing about my job, and I'm not sure that will ever stop being true. We often have the
                same values, and come to different conclusions. We also commonly use different words to say the same
                thing, but we don't quite understand what the other person is saying, so we immediately jump to
                disagreeing with them (because we <em>know</em> that we're right). The helpful thing to do in these
                kinds of conversations, is to try to identify <em>why</em> we're disagreeing, and even
                <em>what</em> we're disagreeing about.
            </p>
            <p>
                I value being opinionated, but this <em>must</em> be tempered with being open to changing my opinion. I
                still struggle with this, and have to be intentional when I approach conversations. I've found that even
                identifying disagreement can help its resolution. We often argue without even knowing what we're arguing
                about. It's pretty helpful to try to restate what someone else's opinions are, without making any kind
                of judgement on them -- &quot;Can I try to restate your opinion to make sure I understand? You think ...
                because ...?&quot;
            </p>
            <p>Being opinionated only works in an environment of trust and a willingness to change your opinion.</p>
