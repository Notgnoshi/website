# Git resources

There's an absolute _wealth_ of information available on Git; reference material, exposition,
guides, how-to's, tutorials, interactive tutorials, videos, best-practices, worst-practices,
opinions, rants, forums, question and answer sites, and probably so much more. Yet even with so much
information available, Git can at times be impenetrable, confusing, unwelcoming, and "difficult"
enough to be perceived as a _distraction_ from the "real work".

The motivation for this page is to provide some resources that I have found helpful in learning Git;
out of the overwhelming number of resources available, it's sometime difficult to filter through the
noise to find the resource you need.

### Aside: Is Git a distraction?

I hear this perspective a lot (less now?) and find it grating. The idea that Git is a "distraction"
from the "real work" of writing code is... difficult to handle.

Writing code has _never_ been the "real work" of software engineering. For me, that's always been
_understanding_; understanding _what_ to write, _why_ to write it, and at times, understanding what
the $%#@ the previous developer was thinking.

This perspective -- and it's a common one, I think -- that the previous developers were bumbling
incompetent idiots, is one that I'd caution pretty strongly against. I've often found that it's
_myself_ that has misunderstood what I'm looking at.

At other times though, even though I may be disappointed at the state of things today, I've found
that questionable code has made (some) amount of sense in context.

So when I write software today, I try pretty hard to provide that context in the form of structured,
atomic commits, by paying attention to the commit messages, and by trying to add useful comments,
documentation, and tests. And it's already proven useful!

## Official resources

The official Git documentation is a pleasure. There's both long-form prose, and terse reference
material, and they're both helpful.

* https://git-scm.com/docs -- reference
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 -- long-form prose

### Aside: Long-form documentation is the _best_

When I think back to the best documentation I've ever used, it's always been the long-form
documentation that stands out. This is where projects like [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2),
[ZMQ](https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter1/) stand out -- their long-form documentation is
_exactly_ what I want.

## Bottom-up explorations

I _really_ like to understand how things work. I enjoy articles and blog posts that build things
from the bottom up. This is one of the things I think I enjoyed the most out of my mathematics
degree -- was seeing how this massive scope of work was built up from first principles.

So the Git resources that stick out to me, are the ones that explain how the internals work, the
ones that explain Git from the bottom-up.
