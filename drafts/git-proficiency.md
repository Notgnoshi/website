# Git proficiency

At work, there's a few philosophies related to Git usage.

My philosophy is that _professionals_ are _proficient_ with their tools. If that's not something you
care about, fine, you can go write your code in that corner over there.

When Git is used well, it's empowering. It enables _archaeology_ -- interrogating a project to
understand how and why some troublesome piece of code got to where it was. This is _valuable_.
